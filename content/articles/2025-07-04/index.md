I'm running a new [**Daggerheart**](https://www.daggerheart.com/) [Roll20 game](https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/details/19862046/daggerheart-quickstart-official-learn2play)!
{{< /lead >}}

I'm excited to give the [official Daggerheart Quickstart Adventure](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/daggerheart/sources/quick-start-adventure/introduction) a try with adventurers. I'm glad they provided this out-of-the-box on Demiplane. This adventure is just what I needed to really experience the mechanics and learn the platform together with players.

> #### The Sablewood Messengers
> Marlowe Fairwind, the right-hand sorcerer of King Emeris, has gathered her most trusted allies to carry an important package to Hush, a small village within the ancient forest of Sablewood. The crate is large, heavy and sealed with magic, addressed to the Whitefire Arcanist. Youâ€™ve been given a map and a carriage, and the promise of reward upon your arrival.

It is for **up to 5 players**, though some folks have reported running with one or two more - it ended up just extending scene duration (of course) a bit. However, I'm going to really play this as-is. No **homebrew** rules, no special **exceptions** - *just play as they recommend*. We'll see how it goes!

If it goes well, I'll try re-running it for more players, so if you aren't able to join in-time, no worries - maybe soon!
