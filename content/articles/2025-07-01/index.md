[**Daggerheart**](https://www.daggerheart.com/) is the new tabletop RPG exploding in popularity!

While I've not much more than a passing interest in Critical Role, it's no doubt their new RPG platform [Daggerheart](https://www.daggerheart.com/) via [Darrington Press](https://darringtonpress.com/) is making waves across the TTRPG community. **But will it last?**

To be honest, it looks captivating. The rules do away with a good chunk of the grinding "calculatory" bits commonly found in other TTRPGs. They do this by focusing the rules on *driving narrative* - and not letting calculations get in the way of player engagement. In a way, it's more a *game story-telling system* than a *game strategy-analysis* system... and I think that could be a really good thing for what I'd call "casual+" players like myself.

Casual+ TTRPG players like me want engaging stories and fun adventures without getting bogged down in too many rules and conditions that interrupt game play flow. I can't count how many times I've led players through a game narrative only to have it slam into a wall because some nuanced rule someone asks about leads us down an hours-long rabbit hole through rulebooks and online forums.

I, like many other GMs, hate to see the dreary-eyed player reaching for their phones, falling asleep, while others, including myself are essentially forced to go nose deep in books looking for answers. It's just not engaging.

> Will Daggerheart change this? I **hope** so.

However, there is a risk. In many ways, you might not be incorrect to thing Daggerheart is rules-light, maybe like DungeonWorld. Such TTRPG systems carry a risk to gameplay that I call "too-nice" fatigue- where everything is so easy, so overpowered, for players, that there's no challenge or mystery. There's no risk of death because you know a heal is right around the corner. This can be somewhat controlled by GMs, but in some cases, the game mechanics itself make it challenging to do so.

I hope to be running a game on [Roll20 soon for Daggerheart](https://app.roll20.net/users/12231884/orbotik). 

We'll see where it leads. But for now, *this game seems worthy of attention*, and I hope it can deliver.
