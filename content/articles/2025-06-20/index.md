It's true, there's a new project on the way- **FactoryKit**!.
{{< /lead >}}
It's been taking weeks of work through these preliminary stages, but this new 3D printable framework for *factory
automation anywhere* is finally, officially, on it's way!

FactoryKit is not quite ready for primetime yet, but it will be soon. Here's a few things to expect:

1. A clear and consise *standards* guideline to ensure cross-compatibility in the community.
2. Parts and pieces to add, customize, and connect FactoryKit compatible widgets together.
3. A launch of at least one set of widgets of FactoryKit.
4. A free-to-use license for hobbyists & enthusiasts.
5. An no-nonsense and no-cost accessible commerical license for monetized Youtubers, bloggers, education & training,
   social media influencers, and derivative creators & inventors. Also with an alternative pathway for anyone 
   else who wants to sell FactoryKit originals.
6. A continuing effort to release even more!
