It's true, there's a new project on the way- **FactoryKit**!.
{{< /lead >}}
It's been taking weeks of work through these preliminary stages, but this new 3D printable framework for *factory
automation anywhere* is finally, officially, on it's way!

These widgets are being designed to be interchangable, connectable, and highly customizable. In-fact the first designs
to hit [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@orbotik) will be [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) designs which let you
pick-and-choose from a set of options per-widget!

FactoryKit is not quite ready for primetime yet, but it will be soon. Here's a few things to expect:

1. A clear and consise *standards* guideline to ensure cross-compatibility in the community.
2. Parts and pieces to add, customize, and connect FactoryKit compatible widgets together.
3. A launch of at least one set of widgets of FactoryKit.
4. A free-to-use license for hobbyists, educators, & enthusiasts.
5. A no-nonsense and no-cost accessible commerical license for monetized Youtubers, bloggers, education & training,
   social media influencers, and derivative creators & inventors. And an alternative pathway for anyone else who wants
   to sell FactoryKit originals.
6. An introductory video and series of videos dedicated to the creation, use, and announcements for all things 
   FactoryKit on the [@orbotik](https://www.youtube.com/@orbotik) YouTube channel.
7. A continuing effort to release even more widgets!

## Soon To Be
So when's this expected to begin? Well, I don't have an exact date- there's so much more work to do, but for sure in
the next 2-3 months! Stay tuned fellow tuners!
