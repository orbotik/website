Hi folks! Thanks for dropping in. Today, I'm happy to announce the launch of my new public channel website [orbotik.com](https://orbotik.com). This site will be host to all my content, including new [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/orbotik), [3D prints](https://makerworld.com/en/@orbotik), inventions, games, hobbies, and so much more!

I have a few announcements coming in the next few days/weeks that I can't wait to share with you! My first video is already in production, but I can't divulge the secrets just yet, it will be amazing! (◕ᴥ◕ʋ)
