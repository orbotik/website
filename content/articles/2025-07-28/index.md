So I completed GMing my first [**Daggerheart**](https://www.daggerheart.com/) [Roll20 game](https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/details/19862046/daggerheart-quickstart-official-learn2play)!
{{< /lead >}}

It was a full house and it went really well. What struck me was how easy this game was to pick up. Within just a few scenes folks really started to 
work together and move the story forward. The game has this unique balance of narrative-sharing between the GM and players that I haven't quite
found in other TTRPG platforms. While the GM is fully capable of driving core worldbuilding - it opens the door for players to actively be part of
it, and not only that, actively narrate and describe their characters and actions.

Part of this is the near-ellimination of the combat-slog. The combat slog I've found all-to-often in D&D, Pathfinder, and OSR games where combat
becomes more like filling out a spreadsheet instead of an active and intense battle for life and glory. With Daggerheart, and especially leveraging 
Demiplane character sheets, it makes taking actions really simple. A click of the button and you make your roll, then tell us what happened!

Here's an exchange I had during the game (roughly reconstructed):

> **GM (Me):** "You land the killing blow on the skeleton, tell us how it went down?"    
> **Player:** "I swing my massive arms above my head, and with the strength of my arms I swing down with all force and wreck the skeleton - bones flying everywhere."    
> **GM (Me):** "Only dust and bits remain!"

There's engagement, there's action. What's more is there's actually a story to tell, not a document to fill out or checkboxes to check. I can't recommend this game enough. 

### Tokens
As part of running the game on Roll20, I love to prepare maps. I'm really glad I found 2minute Tabletop's asset packs - they are really amazing at not going
overboard with "realism" that can, to a degree, over-complicate things. The art-style is somewhat like an American-drawn and Studio Ghibli mix. This lends the
assets to being amazingly easy to modify and adjust, not to mention they have a token customizer tool. How cool is that!

Here's a few tokens for the Daggerheart official quickstart I put together and customized:
